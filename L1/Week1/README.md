Level 1

## 1. Background in Quantitative Finance
The thing that first sparked my interest within the world of Quantitative Finance is my internship I did my senior year and summer going into freshman year of college. During
my time in the office of a precious metals trading desk, I learned many differnet aspects that go into the trading world, I learned key functions and market termonolagy from
expereienced traders. This is what sparked my interest in the trading realm, but as I got deeper into it I realized there were many different paths within it. One of them being
presented to me when I came to SMU, the quantitative traders club, with my background from my internship, I knew immediatly I wanted to join a club of likeminded people
interested in trading. This was my first introduction into the quant world and wanted to learn more through the opportunity presented to me.


## 2. Career Goals

This is a difficult question for me since I am still trying to figure out what field I want to commit myself to. I am currently an econ major but have hopes to transfer into
COX to start my journey in finance. As of right now I am going down the "trading" path you could say, some roles that interest me is a commodity trader since this is the
field I did my internship in and the only one I have experience with. A company that I am interested in like many other kids in my position is JP Morgan, an exclusive and
prestigious corporation. In a year from now I hope to be some sort of major in COX, in 5 years from now I would like to have a good job and hopefully looking to clib the
ranks of the firm I join. In 10 years I hope to be able to look for the opportunity of starting my own proprietary trading desk.


## 3. What I Hope to Learn from This Program

Having a small background in trading already I feel I am ready to take on more advanced trading strategy and go more in depth with those. A big thing is developing my overall
math skills, like stats. I have 0 background in coding, and with the quant club which is heavily dependent on coding I would like to learn some of the basics of python.
With the path I am on, the main thing I would like to focus on is information on what affects markets and how to capitilize on opportunities when these affects occure.
Developing my overall market knowledge.


## 4. Current Technical Skills

For Programming languages, such as python, c++, java, ect. I would rank myself as a beginner in those topics
For Data analysis tools, I would say I am a beginner in this aswell, having little knowledge in the topics
I think I rank around intermediate for statistical analysis with some background knowledge in it.
I would say I am a beginner for financial modeling and a complete beginner in machine learning
I am a beginner in version control.


## 5. Development Plan & Program Goals

I plan on developing mostly my math skills, such as statistical analysis and even hoping to improve my mental math. I also would like to learn more about market analysis and
learn about key features that have affects on the markets. I feel that I can measure my progress by measuring my understanding of market analysis and be able to apply those
strategies to my personal trading. I can measure my math skills by doing progressivly more difficult questions. I plan on commiting 2-4 hrs a week within the club. I think
some resources that may help is quantopian and the green book. My definition of success in this program is being able to apply the skills learned to my personal trading
straregies and even beyond just trading.
